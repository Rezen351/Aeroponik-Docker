# Development

[See here](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/contributing/widgets/third-party.html) for general information about developing third party widgets for `@flowfuse/node-red-dashboard`


## Develop locally in a Docker container

If you want to run Node-RED in a Docker container and use that to develop widgets you must follow these steps:

### Setup 
Necessary only once

Simply run `./docker-start.sh`

or do it manually:

1. Start Node-RED Docker container with a volume mounted at `/data` that points to a local directory
2. Install `@flowfuse/node-red-dashboard` either via Web UI (Settings->Manage Palette) or by installing it via `npm` in the directory of the docker volume
3. Restart docker container

### Publish
Necessary after every change to the code.
As the Docker container cannot access your local files directly, you need to copy the code to the shared volume

Simply run `./docker-dev.sh`

or do it manually:

1. Build the code with `npm run build` or `npm run build:dev`
2. Create a `.tgz` npm bundle with `npm pack`
3. Change directory to the share docker volume and run `npm install PATH/TO/TGZ-FILE` 
4. Restart docker container (can be skipped if only changes to the widgets in `/ui` were made)
